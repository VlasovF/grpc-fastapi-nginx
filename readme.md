# Fast-Api and gRPC with Nginx under docker
gRPC example showing convenience in making service for saving data

## Components
1. FastApi application in fastapi-finder/app/ folder.
2. Request example on aiohttp in fastapi-finder/client/ folder
3. gRPC server/client in grpc-saver/server and /client folders
4. nginx
5. storage for mounting in containers (for cooperative using pysondb base)

## For making changes in gRPC-part
After changing docs.proto you need execute for server and client folders command: 
```bash
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I./ --python_out=. --pyi_out=. --grpc_python_out=. ./docs.proto
```
It will update generated by grpc files.

## Request examples
For gRPC client you can find example of client usage in /client/example_using_client.py
For FastApi you can find  aiohttp request example in /client/examlpe.py.
